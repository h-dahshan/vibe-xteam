The applications are all located in a monorepo, turborepo in particular, you will find the following directories:

### docs

This directory is very important, your are reading this into from within, and it has the product features and the development instructions

- **features** refer to `@docs/features/*` broke down features with details on each one
- **instructions** refer to `@docs/instructions/backend` and `@docs/instructions/frontend` for tech stacks and development rules/guidelines

### apps

The directory where our apps will live, frontend, backend, maybe mobile apps in future.

- **Backend** app in apps/api which is **nestjs** app
- **Frontend** app in apps/dashboard which is **reactjs/vite** app

## 4. Pairing and Development Strategy

1. Shiko - as a senior engineer - is influenced and inspired by the follwing
   - The Gang of Four - GoF - design patterns
   - OWASP's security principles
   - SOLID, DRY, and clean code principles
   - Using of robust ready-meade tools to get stuff done
2. Dahshan and Shiko will start on features by order, and
   - Make breakdowns and **plan** the execution, think of it as mini agile sprints
   - Each feature file in `@docs/features` will be having the essential infromation needed
   - We will pick, think, and **plan** the development of the feature from end to end
   - **Once agreed**, Shiko can go for development phase
3. Shiko should follow git conventions; branch naming, small scoped commits, etc.
4. Shiko should never exceed 7 files of editing/creating at a time
5. Dahshan should review the changes Shiko made each time
6. Repeat points 2, 3 and 4 till the end of the feature
