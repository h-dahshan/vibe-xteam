# Observability & Reliability Improvements

This document outlines missing/weak spots in the current backend.md strategy and provides a prioritized action plan for strengthening observability, reliability, and security.

---

## Missing / Recommended Additions

### Observability & SRE

- **SLOs / SLIs / Error budgets** — define SLIs (latency p95/p99, availability), SLO targets, and error-budget policies tied to alerts and releases.
- **Alerting specifics & runbooks** — which alerts fire in which order, severity levels, on-call routing (PagerDuty), and an accompanying runbook for each alert (triage steps, mitigation).
- **Alert tuning / suppression / noise control** — alert grouping, deduplication, and escalation policy to avoid fatigue.
- **Synthetic monitoring / uptime checks** — external probes for critical user flows (buy, login).
- **Metrics naming & label guidelines** — conventions, cardinality rules, histogram buckets for latency.
- **Retention & sampling policies** — how long to keep logs/metrics/traces and sampling strategy (traces/logs) to control cost.
- **Cost / telemetry budget** — estimate/limit data ingestion and set sampling/aggregation to reduce cloud bills.

### Logging / Tracing details

- **Log schema / mandatory fields** — timestamp, service, env, level, request_id, trace_id, user_id (if permitted), tenant, module, error_code.
- **Log enrichment & context** — attach user/tenant IDs, feature flags, request metadata.
- **Log sampling & rate limiting** — avoid logging at full verbosity in hot endpoints.
- **Immutable audit log store** — separate write-only store for audit logs (WORM) and retention/archival rules.
- **Access controls for logs** — RBAC for who can view logs (PII restrictions).
- **Trace sampling & span naming** — define sampling rate and naming conventions to make traces useful.

### Reliability / Resilience

- **Circuit breakers, bulkheads, backpressure** — patterns for external dependency failures.
- **Blue/Green / Canary deployments** and feature flags for safer rollout.
- **Chaos testing & failure injection** — (e.g., Gremlin/Chaos Mesh) to validate resilience.
- **Disaster recovery & backups** — DB backup/restore playbooks, RTO/RPO targets, tested recovery drills.
- **Read replicas / failover strategies** for DBs and caches.

### Security & Compliance

- **Secrets management** — Vault/KMS for DB creds, JWT keys, API keys; never env files in plain text.
- **Vulnerability scanning & dependency management** — Snyk/Dependabot, container image scanning, SBOM.
- **Pen-testing & automated security checks** in CI/CD.
- **Data protection policies** — encryption at rest, key rotation, PII handling, data erasure for GDPR.
- **WAF / IDS / anomaly detection** — protect against OWASP threats and detect suspicious traffic.

### CI/CD, Infra & Ops

- **Infrastructure-as-Code** (Terraform/CloudFormation) + drift management.
- **Migration strategy in CI/CD** — how to run/rollback DB migrations safely (locking, blue/green migrations).
- **Immutable infrastructure / image scanning** — Docker image pipeline steps & scanning.
- **Resource quotas & autoscaling policies** — CPU/memory requests/limits and HPA configs.
- **Observability as part of CI** — validate instrumentation, smoke-tests that exercise metrics and health endpoints.

### Data & DB Practices

- **Backup schedule & restore tests**, point-in-time recovery.
- **Archival & retention policies** for old data (cost + compliance).
- **Transactional outbox** / eventual-consistency patterns for reliably emitting events from DB transactions.
- **Data partitioning & multi-tenancy safety** if applicable.

### Testing & QA (observability-specific)

- **Load / stress testing** (k6, Gatling) with SLI measurement.
- **Chaos & resilience tests** in staging.
- **Observability tests** — ensure alerts fire during test faults, health checks trigger expected behaviors.

### Operational Documentation

- **Runbooks, incident postmortem templates**, and post-incident follow-up process.
- **On-call playbooks** (who to contact, temporary mitigations).
- **Architecture diagrams & dependency maps** (service + infra + external).

### Developer ergonomics / API hygiene

- **API versioning & deprecation policy**.
- **Contract tests** (e.g., pact) for external integrations.
- **Rate-limit & quota design for public APIs** (throttling tiers, per-tenant limits).

## Top 8 Prioritized Actions

1. **Define SLOs/SLIs** for your critical user flows (latency, availability).
2. **Add runbooks** for top 5 alerts and tie alerts to PagerDuty/Slack.
3. **Implement request-id propagation + structured log schema** across the app.
4. **Enable Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboard for p95/p99 latency and error rate**.
5. **Set trace sampling and integrate OpenTelemetry** so logs/metrics/traces are correlated.
6. **Add secrets management (Vault/KMS) and container image scanning in CI**.
7. **Create backup & restore playbook and test restore** monthly.
8. **Create an alerting policy to reduce noise** (group alerts, severity, auto-silencing for deploy windows).
